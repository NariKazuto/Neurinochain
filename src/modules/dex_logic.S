;
; dex_logic.S — Decentralized Exchange Logic
; --------------------------------------------
; Handles listing, matching, visibility, and liquidity
; Applies to all tokens across all chains and smallchains.
;
; Includes support for "invisible" system liquidity:
; - Appears automatically every 2880 blocks
; - Minted NEU based on staking total
; - Not tied to any wallet or address
; - Validated locally (deterministic and universal)
;
; Example:
;   Every 2880 blocks:
;     - NEU created = 0.0567% × days × staking_total
;     - Price = current_price × (1 + 0.000567 × days)
;     - Appears in DEX as sell order from system pool
;
; These offers are NOT stored in Merkle root
; but are enforced by consensus and appear in all clients.
