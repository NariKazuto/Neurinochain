# 🧠 Neurinochain

**Neurinochain** is a fully modular blockchain written entirely in Assembly, designed specifically for extreme efficiency, compatibility with low-powered hardware (including old smartphones and Raspberry Pi), and usability via web browsers without installations.

It provides **secure and decentralized financial access** to people who lack traditional financial infrastructure, such as bank accounts or reliable internet connections.

---

## 🌍 Mission: Financial Inclusion

Neurinochain is built explicitly to empower users in developing countries or economically disadvantaged regions, where:

- Traditional banking services are unavailable or unreliable.
- Devices are low-end (e.g., Android Go phones, older hardware).
- Internet connectivity is slow, expensive, or intermittent.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Fully Browser-Based**: Runs completely in-browser using WebAssembly (WASM) without installation.
- **Stateless Design**: Only Merkle roots are stored, transactions self-destruct after confirmation.
- **Ultra-Lightweight**: Assembly-optimized for minimal resource consumption.
- **Automatic Decentralized Exchange (DEX)**: Integrated marketplace without centralized intermediaries.
- **Invisible Staking Rewards**: Rewards appear directly in wallets, reducing complexity for new users.
- **Automatic Reputation System**: Protects against spam and fraud, promoting fairness and trust.
- **Flexible Smallchains**: Community-driven, modular, and easily expandable blockchain modules.
- **Offline Fund Transfers**: Secure offline transactions via Bluetooth, synchronized automatically when online.

## 🔧 Optimized for Low-Power Devices

Neurinochain runs efficiently on:

- Low-end Android devices (Android Go, Android 8 or lower).
- Raspberry Pi or similar single-board computers.
- Legacy Linux computers with minimal specs.

**No complex setup required**: Simply open a browser and begin.

---

## 🧱 Stateless Architecture

- Transactions are automatically deleted after processing and consensus (51% confirmations).
- Only current state (Merkle roots) is maintained.
- No historical data storage is needed, making Neurinochain ideal for devices with minimal storage.

---

## 📱 Easy-to-Use Interface

- Intuitive web-based wallet and exchange (DEX).
