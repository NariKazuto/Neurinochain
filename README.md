# üß† Neurinochain

**Neurinochain** is a fully modular blockchain written entirely in Assembly, designed for extreme efficiency, stateless operation, and compatibility with low-power devices and browsers.

It features:
- Full execution in the browser via WebAssembly (no installation needed)
- Stateless core with only Merkle roots saved
- Auto-scaling reward system and tokenized structure
- Invisible reward minting and transaction-level privacy
- Built-in decentralized DEX and automatic reputation system

---

## üöÄ Key Features

- Runs on any browser or OS (including Raspberry Pi, Android, Linux)
- Uses only WebAssembly and static assets (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Supports both full mainchain and modular "smallchains"
- Every object is a token: mainchain, tokens, smallchains, DEX orders
- Zero database: only Merkle roots are saved
- Invisible staking rewards and automatic DEX liquidity
- No Tor required (but optionally compatible)
- Fully customizable fee system per operation
- User-loadable modules per smallchain
- Optional display names and logos in the UI

---

## üß± Stateless Architecture

Neurinochain uses a "pure state" model:
- Transactions are **autodestroyed** after processing and 51% sync confirmations
- Only the **Merkle root of current state** is saved per block
- No transaction logs or historical data needed
- Perfect for low storage environments and private usage

---

## üîê Address Format & Object ID Structure

Neurinochain uses a strict and expandable ID structure to identify all objects in the network.

### üîπ Internal Format: `ENCODED_BODY` only (Base32)

- Internally, all objects are referenced by a Base32 string only
- The structure inside the encoded body defines:
  - Chain ID
  - Object type (token, wallet, etc.)
  - Object-specific data (hash, pubkey, etc.)

### üîç Visual Naming (UI-only)

For users, each object can display an optional visual name and icon in wallets, explorers, and DEX listings.
The actual ID used by the chain remains a pure Base32 `ENCODED_BODY` like:
```
MFZXKZ3WOBSWIIDTNF2HI3DJNZTGS4TDL5XGIY3JLFBQ
```

UI display may optionally show:
```
SupplyNet / token / MFZXKZ3WOBSWIIDTNF2HI3DJNZTGS4TDL5XGIY3JLFBQ
```
This is for readability only and not used by consensus or Merkle state.

#### UI Metadata Example (JSON-like):
```json
{
  "id": "MFZXKZ3WOBSWIIDTNF2HI3DJNZTGS4TDL5XGIY3JLFBQ",
  "name": "SupplyNet",
  "type": "token",
  "logo": "/webapp/assets/tokens/MFZXKZ3WOBSWIIDT....svg"
}
```

### üìÅ Optional Local Assets

UI logos and names are not stored on-chain. They can be added locally by users or chain creators.

All object IDs are internally pure `ENCODED_BODY` strings. File names must match exactly.

| Object Type | Path Example                                        | Max Size          |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Chain       | `/webapp/assets/chains/MFZXKZ3WOBSWIIDT....svg`     | ‚â§ 8 KB            |
| Token       | `/webapp/assets/tokens/ABCDABCDABCDAB....svg`       | ‚â§ 8 KB            |
| Custom Code | `/webapp/assets/custom/XYZXYZXYZXYZYZ....svg`       | ‚â§ 8 KB            |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Chain       | `/webapp/assets/chains/<ENCODED_BODY>.svg`         | ‚â§ 8 KB            |
| Token       | `/webapp/assets/tokens/<ENCODED_BODY>.svg`         | ‚â§ 8 KB            |
| Custom OBJ  | `/webapp/assets/obj/<ENCODED_BODY>.svg`            | ‚â§ 8 KB            |

## üí∏ Reward Logic

- Every block mints **10 NEU** magically (not via transaction)
- Fees are also distributed magically ‚Äî only the result appears in wallet balances
- No reward or fee distribution is included in the Merkle root or transaction list
- All rewards are added directly to wallet balances as state changes

### Distribution:
- Rewards are split **proportionally** to stake among all synchronized nodes
- The node that forges the block receives **+10% bonus** on its share
- Nodes not synchronized at the time receive **nothing**

### Additional Rules:
- Rewards do **not automatically enter staking**
- Nodes must sell **at least 50% of their reward on the DEX** to stay eligible
- If a node generates 10 blocks within the last 2880 blocks, it is excluded for 2880 blocks
- A minimum stake threshold applies and increases every 2880 blocks (+0.0567%)
- Failure to meet daily stake quota results in progressive penalty (‚àí0.0567%, ‚àí0.1134%, etc.) deducted from reward
- The penalty difference is assigned to the block forger

---

## üíß DEX & Invisible Liquidity

- Every 2880 blocks, NEU are minted = 0.0567% √ó staking total
- Listed in DEX at +0.0567% price increase per day
- These orders **appear magically** and are not from wallets
- Validated by all clients without needing inclusion in Merkle root

---

## üìä Reputation System

- Fully automatic and consensus-driven
- Every wallet, token, chain, node starts at 100%
- Reputations adjust based on:
  - Activity (positive actions generate votes)
  - Honest staking
  - Voting consistency
  - Error rates, invalid tx, DEX spam
- Inactivity = neutral (no penalty)
- Negative behavior triggers automatic penalties
- Recovery is possible over time through good behavior
- Fraud or bugs detected automatically can trigger reversal or state correction
- Reputation is stored as non-removable percentage visible in all interfaces

---

## üß™ Local Test Mode: `localmain`

- Simulated local blockchain with 10 wallets
- Perfect for testing syncing, rewards, and consensus
- Includes Merkle state, staking, DEX, smallchains ‚Äî all offline
- Can simulate node desync and recovery logic

## üîß Modules Overview

### `/src/core/`
- `mainchain_init.S` ‚Äî Boot logic
- `block_format.S` ‚Äî Block structure and rewards
- `address_encode.S` ‚Äî (to be implemented) logic to decode Base32 `ENCODED_BODY`, extracting chain ID, object ID, and type
- `constants.S` ‚Äî Chain-wide parameters

### `/src/modules/`
- `object_create.S` ‚Äî Create token, smallchain or NFT. Smallchains are created as enhanced tokens by setting specific flags and attaching modular logic. Mainchain is predefined and not created here.
- `object_transfer.S` ‚Äî Transfer handler
- `object_registry.S` ‚Äî Registry for chain/token
- `object_properties.S` ‚Äî Flags and features (mintable, dex_enabled...)
- `staking_main.S` ‚Äî Staking rewards and consensus logic
- `fee_logic.S` ‚Äî Custom fee logic for token-specific adjustments (optional). Global fees are defined in `fees.S` and used by default; this module is used only if a token overrides the base fee behavior.
- `dex_logic.S` ‚Äî Base DEX matching
- `dex_liquidity_mint.S` ‚Äî Magical DEX liquidity injection
- `vote_reputation.S` ‚Äî Event-based reputation updates
- `auto_reputation.S` ‚Äî Full auto reputation engine
- `marketplace_store.S`, `royalty_logic.S` ‚Äî NFT/digital asset sales
- `pruning.S`, `merkle_storage.S` ‚Äî Storage and cleanup

### `/src/fees/`
- `fees.S` ‚Äî Global fee logic for all operations (chain creation, token issue, transfers, voting, DEX, etc.)

### `/src/custom/`
- (planned) Modules to allow smallchains to register and expose personal logic.
- Not yet implemented. Future versions will load external logic per chain, but all modules will be internally referenced using only the `ENCODED_BODY`. The legacy `00_00_OBJ_` prefix is no longer used.
- User-defined modules (once supported) will be visible on the network as `00_00_OBJ_...`, but until `loader.S` and `verifier.S` are implemented, this behavior is reserved for future support of custom logic

### `/webapp/`
- `index.html` ‚Äî Browser wallet/DEX frontend
- `wallet.js`, `wasm_loader.js`, `style.css`
- `assets/chains/` ‚Äî Optional SVG or PNG logos for smallchains
- `assets/tokens/` ‚Äî Logos for tokens
- `assets/obj/` ‚Äî Logos for custom user modules
