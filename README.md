# Neurinochain
Neurinochain is a modular blockchain in Assembly, built for low-power devices and slow networks. Smallchains are created like enhanced tokens without halting the mainchain. Fully isolated yet extendable, with advanced token logic and no dependencies. Efficient, resilient, and accessible.
